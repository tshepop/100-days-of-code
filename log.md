# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating the index file , worked on the script file to add functionality for the random quote generator app. Created a Github repository, pushed all my changes to the repo. Still Codepen outstanding?

**Thoughts:** I will add CSS later. I feel like I am slowly forcing myself to finally commit, after putting it of form months. Learning is a journey :)
